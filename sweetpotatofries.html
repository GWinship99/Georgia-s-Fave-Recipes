        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>This may sound controversial, but I'm not the biggest lover of run of the mill fries. I'd much rather eat a plate filled with their sweeter,
            healthier alternative, the sweet potato fry. It's very easy to burn or overcook sweet potato fries but if they're done perfectly, they are mouth-wateringly good.
            Here's a higly related recipe on how to make this amazing side!
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p>2 lbs sweet potatoes</p>
        <p>1 tbsp cornstarch</p>
        <p>1/2 tsp salt</p>
        <p>2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil </p>
        <p>cayenne, ground pepper, paprika if you want them spiced</p>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <p>1. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit with racks in the lower and upper thirds. 
            Line two large, rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper so the fries don't stick to the pans</p>
        <p>2. Peel the sweet potatoes and cut them into fry shaped pieces that are 1/4 wide and 1/4 thick. Transfer half of the fry pieces onto 1 baking sheet. Transfer the other half to another baking sheet</p>
        <p>3. Sprinkle the sweet potato fries with the cornstarch (use 1 1/2 tsp per pan) and salt (1/4 tsp per pan). Toss until the fries are lightly coated in powder. Drizzle the olive oil over the fries (1 tbsp per pan) 
            and toss until the fries are lightly and even coated in oil, and no powdery spots remain (rub any remains into the fries with your fingers).</p>
        <p>4. Arrange your fries in a single layer and don't overcrowd; otherwise they will never get crispy. Bake for 20 minutes, then flip the fries so they can cook on all sides. </p>
        <p>5. Arrange the fries in even layers across the pans again, moving any particularly cooked fries towards the middle the pan so they don't overcook. Return the pans to the oven, swapping their positions.</p>
        <p>6. Bake for 10 to 18 more minutes, or until the fries are crispy. You'll know they're almost done when the surface of the fries changes from a shiny orange to a matte orange. Keep an eye on them, as they can burn easily. 
            Sometimes the lower pan will be done before the top pan. Don't worry if the edges are a bit brown, they are caramelized.</p>
        <p>7. If desired, toss the fries with seasonings to taste. Serve warm! </p>
