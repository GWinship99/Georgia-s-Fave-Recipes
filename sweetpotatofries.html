        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>This may sound controversial, but I'm not the biggest lover of run of the mill fries. I'd much rather eat a plate filled with their sweeter,
            healthier alternative, the sweet potato fry. It's very easy to burn or overcook sweet potato fries but if they're done perfectly, they are mouth-wateringly good.
            Here's a higly related recipe on how to make this amazing side!
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p>2 lbs sweet potatoes</p>
        <p>1 tbsp cornstarch</p>
        <p>1/2 tsp salt</p>
        <p>2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil </p>
        <p>cayenne, ground pepper, paprika if you want them spiced</p>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <p>1. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit with racks in the lower and upper thirds. 
            Line two large, rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper so the fries don't stick to the pans</p>
        <p>2. Peel the sweet potatoes and cut them into fry shaped pieces that are 1/4 wide and 1/4 thick. Transfer half of the fry pieces onto 1 baking sheet. </p>
        <p>3. Heat the ghee over high heat in a large frying pan. Take the chicken out of the marinade but don't wipe the marinade off the chicken 
            and also don't pour the marinade in the pan.
        </p>
        <p>4. Place the chicken in the frying pan and cook for around 3 minutes, or until the chicken is white all over.</p>
        <p>5. Add the tomato passata, cream, sugar and salt. Also add the remaining marinade from the bowl and turn the heat down to low so it can simmer for 20 minutes. Add more salt to taste if need be.</p>
        <p>6. Garnish with coriander or cilantro and serve the now cook curry with your choice of rice.</p>
        <p>7. If you want some sides with your curry,I recommend naan bread and poppadoms!</p>
