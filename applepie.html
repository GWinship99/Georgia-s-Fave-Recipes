        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>This dessert is classic personified. The chewy warmth of the pastry, the sweetness of the apples and the warm (or cold) vanilla taste from the custard.
            Apple Pie id one of my favourite fruity puddings to eat for a reason and this recipe will teach you how to make the ultimate apple pie!
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p>1kg Bramley apples</p>
        <p>140g golden caster sugar</p>
        <p>1/2 tsp cinnamon</p>
        <p>3 tbsp flour</p>
        <p>225g butter</p>
        <p>50g golden caster sugar</p>
        <p>2 eggs</p>
        <p>350g plain flour</p>
        <p>whipped cream</p>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <p>1. Put a layer of paper towels on a large baking sheet. Quaarter, core, peel and slice the apples about 5mm thick 
            and lay evenly on the bakimg sheet. Put paper towels on top and set aside while you make and chill the pastry.
        </p>
        <p>2. For the pastry, beat the butter and sugar in a large bowl until just mixed. Break in a whole egg and a yolk. 
            Beat together for just under 1 minute - it will look a bit like scrambled egg. Now work im the flour with a wooden
            spoon, a third at a time, until it's beginning to clump up, then finish gatherng it together with your hands. Gently
            work the dough into a ball, wrap in cling film, and chill for 45 minutes. Now mix the 140g sugar, the cinnamon and flour
            for the filimg in a bowl that is large enough to take the apples later.
        </p>
        <p>3. After the pastry has chilled, heat the oven to 190c/fan 170c/gas 5. Ligtly beat the egg white with a fork. Cut off a third of pastry 
            and keep it wrapped while you roll out the rest, and use this to line a pie tin - 20-22cm round and 4cm deep - leaving a slight overhang. 
        Roll the remaining third to a circle about 28cm in diameter. Pat the apples dry with kitchen paper, and tip them into the bowl with the cinnamon sugar 
    mix. Give a quick mix with your hands and immediately pile high into the pastry lined tin.</p>
    <p>4. Brush a little water around the pastry rim and lay the pastry lid over the apples pressing the edges together to seal. Trim the edge with a sharp knife
        and make 5 little slashes on top of the lid for the steam to escape. Brush it all with the egg white and sprinkle with caster sugar. Bake for 40-45 minutes, until golden,
        then remove and let it sit for 5-10 mins. Sprinkle with more sugar and serve while still warm from the oven with softly whipped cream.
