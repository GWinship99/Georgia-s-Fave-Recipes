        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Onion Rings are a go to side dish for me, whether it's at home, when I get takeaway 
            or when I'm dining in a restaurant. I just love the crunchiness and chewiness 
            and the slight sweetness that you get from the onion. Please enjoy this recipe as much as I enjoy enjoy rings, hehe!</p>
        <h2>Ingredient</h2>
        <p>One large onion, sliced into seperated 1cm rings</p>
        <p>groundnut oil, for deep frying</p>
        <p>150g self-raising flour</p>
        <p>180ml sparkling water</p>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <p>1. Use a fork to steady your onion and then slice the onion into rings about 1cm wide. Remove the skin and seperate the rings.</p>
        <p>2. Heat the oil to 180c in a heavy based pan - it should be no more than 1/3 full.</p>
        <p>3. Meanwhile put the flour and sparking water in a bowl and generously season. whisk together to form a batter</p>
        <p>4. Coat a small batch of onion rings in the batter. Carefully lower into the hot oil and deep fry until crisp and golden, about 2-3 minutes.
            Remove with a slotted spoon and place on a kitchen towel to drain. Repeat with the rest of the onion rings and batter.
