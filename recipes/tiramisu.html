        <h2>Prep Time: 30 minutes</h2>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p>400ml double cream</p>
        <p>250g mascarpone</p>
        <p>75ml marsala wine</p>
        <p>5 tbsp golden caster sugar</p>
        <p>300ml coffee which is made from 2 tbsp coffee granules and 300ml boiling water</p>
        <p>175g sponge fingers</p>
        <p>25g dark chocolate</p>
        <p>2tsp cocoa powder</p>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <p>1. Put the double cream, mascarpone, marsala wine and golden caster sugar in a large bowl.</p>
        <p>2. Whisk until the cream and mascarpone have completely combined and have the consistency of thickly whipped cream.</p>
        <p>3. Pour the coffee into a shallow dish. Dip in a few of the sponge fingers at a time, turning for a few seconds until they are nicely soaked, but not soggy.
            Layer these in a dish until you've used half the sponge fingers, then spread over half of the creamy mixture.
        </p>
        <p>4. Using the coarse side of the grater, grate over most of the dark chocolate. Then repeat the layers (use up all the coffee), finishing with the creamy layer.</p>
        <p>5. Cover and chill for a few hours or overnight. Make sure to eat before two days have elapsed of it being in the fridge.</p>
        <p>6. To serve, dust the tiramisu with the cocoa powder and grate over the remainder of the chocolate.</p>
