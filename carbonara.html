        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>I am a BIG pasta lover, and one of my all time fave pasta dishes to eat is spaghetti carbonara.
            I just love the cheesy creaminess and the slight meaty notes you get from the pancetta style bacon that usually accompanies it.
            It's an all time Italian classic that I just had to include in my online portfolio piece.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p>100g pancetta</p>
        <p>50g pecorino cheese</p>
        <p>50g parmesan</p>
        <p>3 large eggs</p>
        <p>350g spaghetti</p>
        <p>2 plump peeled and whole garlic cloves</p>
        <p>50g unslted butter</p>
        <p>sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <p>1. Put a large saucepan of water on to boil.</p>
        <p>2. Finely chop the 100g pancetta, having first removed any rind. Finely grate 50g pecorina cheese and 50g parmesan and mix them together.</p>
        <p>3. Beat the 3 large eggs in a medium bowl and season with a little freshly grated black pepper. Set aside.</p>
        <p>4. Add 1 tsp salt to the boiling water, add 350g spaghetti and when the water comes back to boil, cook at a constant simmer, with lid covering it, for 10 minutes or until al dente.</p>
        <p>5. Squash 2 peeled plump garlic cloves with the blade of a knife to bruise them.</p>
        <p>6. While the spaghetti is cooking,, fry the pancetta with the garlic. Drop 50g of unsalted butter into a large frying pan or wok and, as soon as the butter melts, tip in the pancetta and garlic.</p>
        <p>7. Leave to cook on a medium heat for about 5 minutes, stirring often, until the pancetta is golden and crisp. The garlic has used all its flavour so discard it with a slotted spoon.</p>
        <p>8. Keep the heat under the pancetta on low. When the pasta is ready, lift it from the water with tongs or a pasta fork and put it in the frying pan with the pancetta. Don't throw the pasta water away.</p>
        <p>9. Mix most of the cheese in with the eggs, keeping a small handful back for sprinkling over later.</p>
        <p>10. Take the pan of spaghetti and pancetta off the heat. Quickly pour in the eggs and cheese. Using tongs or a long fork, lift up the spaghetti so it mixes easily with the egg mixture, which thickens but doesn't scramble and everything coated.</p>
        <p>11. Add extra pasta water to keep it saucy. You don't wnt it wet, just moist. Season with a little salt if need be.</p>
        <p>12. Use a long pronged fork to twist the pasta onto the serving plate or bowl. Serve immediately with a sprinking of cheese and a grating of black pepper. If the dish gets dry, splash in more hot pasta water to revive the moisture.</p>
