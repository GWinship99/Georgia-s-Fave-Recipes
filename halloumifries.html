        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Halloumi Fries are a great alternative to normal fries and they are a personal fave of mine to nibble on before a hearty meal. This recipe uses a spicy yoghurt for the dipping sauce
            but my preferred dipping sauce that I highly recommend is sweet chilli. Enjoy these cheesy, chewy delights to your heart's content!
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p>170g pot of Greek yoghurt</p>
        <p>1 lemon</p>
        <p> 1 tbsp rose harissa</p>
        <p>3 tbsp za'atar</p>
        <p>75g plain flour</p>
        <p>2 x 250g blocks of halloumi</p>
        <p>oil</p>
        <p>mint</p>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <p>1. Mix the yoghurt with the lemon zest and some seasoning, then swirl through the harissa so that you have pockets of hot and cool in the dip.</p>
        <p>2. On a plate, stir the za'atar into the flour, then roll the halloumi in the mixture so it's evenly coated. Heat the oil in a shallow, heavy-bottomed pan
            or a casserole dish until 180 degrees C on a cooking thermometer, or a piece of bread browns in 20 seconds. Working in batches, carefully lower the halloumi into the oil 
            and cook for 2 minutes until crisp and golden, then drain on kitchen paper.
        </p>
        <p>3. Sprinkle over the mint and za'atar, and serve with the lemon wedges and spicy yoghurt for dipping.</p>
