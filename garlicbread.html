        <h2><a id="recipeintro"></a>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Garlic bread has always been one of my favourite starters and sides to order at a restaurant or eat at home. 
            I just love the crunchy texture combined with the fragrant herby flavour of the garlic bread. Plus garlic bread 
            can in itself be a blank canvas as you can top it with essentially anything including cheese, tomato, maybe a bit of pesto too! </p>
        <h2><a id="ingredients"></a>Ingredients</h2>
        <p>1 Loaf of French/Italian Bread</p>
        <p>6 tbsp Butter</p>
        <p>2 Tbsp Olive Oil</p>
        <p>4 cloves of minced garlic</p>
        <p>2 tbsp chopped Parsley</p>
        <p>1/8 tsp Salt</p>
        <p>1/4 tsp garlic powder</p>
        <h2><a id="instructions"></a>Instructions</h2>
        <p>1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit. In a bowl, stir together the room temperature butter, olive oil,
            minced garlic, garlic powder, chopped parsley and salt until relatively smooth (a few small lumps of butter is fine).
        </p>
        <p>2. Cut the loaf of bread in half, into two 12 inch long pieces, then cut each piece open lengthwise. Lay the bread
            on a baking sheet cut sides facing up. Spread the garlic butter mixture evenly over the open surfaces of the bread.
        </p>
        <p>3. Bake the bread for 10-15 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown and crispy. Bake for less time if you prefer
            a softer bread or bake for longer if you like it extra crispy. Cut the bread into 2 inch sections and serve hot. Enjoy!
